# Basics of image processing

Image processing
Computer Vision is a new field for exploring the era of AI and ML.

This file includes colour detection and detecting specified shape and size of any object just by manipluating the edges
and contour detection.

It alos includes face detection,face recognition,lie detection and line following robot algorithm using edge and contour 
detection.

For face detection and recognition you will need haarcascade library which includes pre trained parameters for face,smile,eyes,
hand and many more.

For edge and contour maniplulation you will need imultis,open cv and numpy.

What Numpy basically does is it converts any image or video feeded into the code into a numeric array so that python can easily
work and manipulate it as required.It forms a matrix of image into more understandable way.

The video capture and image capture are the functions of Open cv.

You can also put text on what you will detect by using puttext function of open cv.What this function basically does is it 
puts text of specified fonts and size when the condition of specified detection gets fulfilled.For example if you want to  detects any blue coloured object of specified contour area it finds the centre of that drawn contour and puts text on it as "center".


Here I'm using Pycharm 2020 version as interpretor while the code gets compiled in python 3.6.Just follow the pycharm 
installation steps.

You can also use Atom if you have "Ubuntu" pycharm is supported in both windows and "Linux Mint".
